TL;DR My personal development goals:

+ Share the information that I found useful for self-development.
+ Highlight information related to DevOps and Cloud-native app development.
+ Become a Linux expert (a few years ago, I changed the technology stack from Windows to Linux, but I'm still halfway in this journey).
+ Prove my professional knowledge and competency with certification.
+ Consulting for teams and projects.
+ Automate everything starting with the business processes and ending with the home automation.
+ Practice my favorite programming languages which are C# (.net core), TypeScript, Python 3 and Go.
+ Improve my English and writing skills (my native languages are Ukrainian and Russian).
+ Practice public speaking.
+ Participate in interesting and challenging projects. 

## Thoughts...

Staying in demand as a specialist is the key to success in the modern world. It means having a set of skills that will benefit the company that hires you. My main motivation has always been the feeling that I need to grow further, getting to know specialists who are better than me, to learn from them, take on more complex tasks and responsibility, set new goals, and get a job in a company where I can put all my knowledge into practice.

My blog will often touch on the topic of DevOps Transformation, the process by which the company shifts from traditional methods of batch Software delivery to a DevOps approaches of continuous Software delivery and management. Since DevOps transformation also has implications on process and cultural change, participation at all levels is very important.
My personal DevOps transformation has started while working at Just Eat company (at present Just Eat Takeway.com).
I always was interested in operational side of things, how the application runs in the live environment, how to make it scalable and fault tolerant, how to decrease a time from code to production.
Back in 2016, my transition was from the Software Engineering role (member of a team developing new features) to the Platform Engineering role (member of the team continuously delivering a product for internal consumers).
At that moment I realised that now I see the usual things from several angles. And I liked it.

From that moment I do not feel like just a developer, I continue trying new tools and technologies, and new challenges do not scare me.

But need to remember that the business is not interested in what a cool engineering solution or new technology you used in your previous project if this won't be useful. Moreover, the business perceives only real indicators, such as an increase in the speed of development, deployment, rollback, fault tolerance, recovery from failures, a decrease in the response speed of services, an optimal architecture,  immutability, high availability, scalability, and optimisation of the cost of infrastructure.

On this note, I would like to finish my first post and start preparing the work system for updating to WSL 2 with Kali Linux.

See ya!
