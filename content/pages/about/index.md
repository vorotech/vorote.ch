Hello, I'm Dmytro, and I'm delighted to welcome you to my personal blog.

Staying in demand as a specialist has always been my driving force. It means continually expanding my skill set to bring value to the companies I work with. My journey has been marked by a relentless pursuit of growth, learning from experienced specialists, taking on complex tasks, and setting new goals. I aspire to apply my knowledge to make a meaningful impact in a dynamic work environment.

In this blog, I will explore various topics, with a particular focus on DevOps Transformation. This process represents a shift from traditional batch software delivery to continuous software delivery and management, impacting processes and culture at all levels of an organization.

My own DevOps transformation began in 2016 when I transitioned from a Software Engineering role to Platform Engineering. I've always been drawn to the operational side of thingsâ€”how applications run in live environments, scalability, fault tolerance, and streamlining the code-to-production pipeline. This shift opened new perspectives, enabling me to explore new tools and technologies while setting ambitious goals.

## Personal Development Goals

My goals include:
- Sharing valuable self-development insights.
- Spotlighting DevOps and Cloud-native app development.
- Mastering Linux (a journey I began a few years ago).
- Earning professional certifications.
- Providing consulting expertise for teams and projects.
- Automating processes, from business tasks to home automation.
- Honing coding skills.
- Enhancing my English speaking and writing skills (as a non-native speaker).
- Practicing public speaking.
- Engaging in captivating and challenging projects.

Thank you for visiting my blog. I look forward to sharing knowledge, experiences, and insights with you. Feel free to connect, follow, or reach out anytime.

See you around!
